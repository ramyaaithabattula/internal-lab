      <h3>All England Open: PV Sindhu defeats Nitchaon Jindapol to reach quarterfinals.</h3>
      <p><b>Birmingham:</b> Olympic silver medallist P V Sindhu progressed to the quarterfinals of the All England Championship with a hard-fought win over Thailand's Nitchaon Jindapol in women's singles, here.The world No 3 Indian recovered from a mid-way slump to overcome the Thai shuttler 21-13 13-21 21-18 in a match which lasted an hour and seven minutes.With 2013 champion Ratchanok Inthanon crashing out in the opening round, the onus was on Jindapol to go deep in the tournament and she did produce some superb strokes but Sindhu was always a step ahead.Coming into the contest, Sindhu had a 2-1 head-to-head record against Jindapol, who is enjoying a career-best rank of 11.The Indian kept the shuttle in play, pushing Jindapol to the corners and returning the shuttles with immaculate ease early on.In the first game, the duo split the initial six points before Sindhu jumped to a 7-3 lead after winning a long rally. Sindhu played a brilliant backhand return to move to 8-3 and eventually entered the interval with another precise stroke at the back of the court.After the breather, Sindhu moved to a 15-7 lead and kept piling on the misery on the Thai who kept hitting the net and wide to bleed points.</p>

      <h3>Ex-South Africa cricketer Paul Harris terms Virat Kohli as a 'clown'; here's why</h3>
      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> Reacting to the ban on pacer Kagiso Rabada by the International Cricket Council (ICC) for his conduct, former South Africa cricketer Paul Harris brought Virat Kohli into the controversy, saying the India skipper acted like a "clown" during the South Africa tour and yet faced no consequences for it.The ex-cricketer also accused the ICC of having a prejudice against the South African team."I watched Kohli behave like a clown for three tests here in SA and nothing. Seems to me that @ICC either have an issue with Rabada or with the Proteas in general," Harris wrote on Twitter.Rabada has been facing a Test match ban after being found guilty of breaching Level 2 ICC Code of Conduct offence of "inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with a player".The incident happened after Rabada scalped Australian skipper Steve Smith's crucial wicket for 25 in the first innings of the second Test and celebrated the victory by brushing his shoulder against the departing skipper.Earlier in the day, former England batsman Kevin Pietersen also slammed the ICC's decision to suspend the South African star speedster.Taking to his official Twitter account, Pietersen questioned the current state of Test cricket and voiced his outrage at the ICC's decision.Pietersen wrote that he was pretty happy not to be playing Test cricket in the current scenario.</p><br>
